# Synergy Design Project

A collaborative Design Platform for Localized Automated Abundance

Open Synergy is a collaborative, open-source platform aimed at empowering communities to design, build, and manage localized access to renewable resources and automated production methods. The project focuses on personal, social, and ecological health, emphasizing interconnected benefits and objective assessment parameters. By utilizing real-time data integration, accessible design tools, and a strong community knowledge base, Open Synergy seeks to maximize automation and efficiency, while promoting bioremediation, biodiversity restoration, and agroecology.
