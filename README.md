# Synergy Design Project

A collaborative Design Platform for Localized Automated Abundance

Open Synergy is a collaborative, open-source platform aimed at empowering communities to design, build, and manage localized access to renewable resources and automated production methods. The project focuses on personal, social, and ecological health, emphasizing interconnected benefits and objective assessment parameters. By utilizing real-time data integration, accessible design tools, and a strong community knowledge base, Open Synergy seeks to maximize automation and efficiency, while promoting bioremediation, biodiversity restoration, and agroecology.

## Key Features:

1. **Personal, Social & Ecological Health:**
   - Interconnected, synergistic health benefits
   - Objective parameters to assess local, regional, and global scales
   - Focus on bioremediation, restoring biodiversity, and agroecology

2. **Open Source, Local & Renewable:**
   - Open access to all resources, designs, and technology with no legal restrictions
   - Emphasis on locally sourced, renewable production materials
   - Support for legacy infrastructure upcycling and resource recapture

3. **Real-Time Data Integration:**
   - Access to and creation of real-time data APIs
   - Integration of IoT, weather, and other sensor data
   - Resource availability, production capacity, and efficiency optimization
   - GIS, OpenMap data, spatial analysis, visualization, distribution, land use, and infrastructure
   - Objective, data-driven feedback and decentralized user feedback
   - Initially we will leverage GPT4 and the plugin system to pull data

4. **Accessible Collaborative Design Tools:**
   - Singular, simplified, web-based interface would be ideal
   - Tools for creating, modifying, sharing, and version control
   - Support for AR/VR and other immersive technologies
   - Support for 3D printing, CNC, and other fabrication methods
   - Blender is the most likely candidate for design tools

5. **Maximize Automation & Efficiency:**
   - Minimization of waste and resource usage
   - Focus on net benefit (value) and ecological improvements

6. **Community + Al Knowledge Base:**
   - Foster a global community for collaboration, idea sharing, and support
   - Provide tutorials, best practices, case studies, and real-time data output
